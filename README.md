# Sales-Analysis-TMNT

## Introduction
My current training at Utiva included a Capstone Project focused on the TMNT stores dataset. This project allowed me to practice my data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills using Excel. Additionally, I created a reporting dashboard to showcase my findings from the dataset. Overall, the project was an excellent opportunity to apply what I learned in the training and gain hands-on experience with real-world data.

### Problem Statement
-	What is the total revenue?
- What is the total Profit made?

We were expected to make a report for 
-	Revenue trend?
-	Product by revenue?
-	Revenue Contribution (%) of the product categories?
-	Sales team by revenue?
-	State by revenue, also showing their population and the median income per state?

Create a dashboard with the report and sliceable by:
-	Product category

Include a textbox to highlight the following insights:
-	Which are the 2 top revenue products in January
-	Which sales team made the most revenue from Decoratives in March?
-	What is the relationship between revenue, population, and median income of the states
